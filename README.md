# goGameProject
A go boardgame project made in my 2nd year in engineering school.
The goal was to implement different strategies for a go player. Goban interface was used to display the board on terminal, gnuGo player was used as a reference to our player perfomance. The alphaBeta method was used for our player.
The project is written in python.
